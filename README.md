This project is a standalone Angular JS Bootstrap applications that can be deployed on any server that will talk to back end REST services to serve the client

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repo is intended to be a front end web application for Navigator and other Germinate Services
* 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
* Project doc here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iBLCaELXJ4GEfCyIgCv_IuHySg0EeZ-vhM8-gjaSkA8/edit

### How do I get set up? ###

* This is dependent on germinate-navigator rest services meaning that it won't work if it's not up and running
* It's self sufficient and uses the js libraries within the project
* No database connections required as it consumes REST
* No test cases added as it's pure front end but subsequent versions should add some test cases
* Deploy on any complaint server as this project is language agnostic
